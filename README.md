# Basic-Chatbot

## Basic chatbot using GUI

A simple and interactive chatbot application built using Python's Tkinter library and NLTK. This chatbot utilizes pattern matching to respond to user inputs and provides a user-friendly graphical interface for seamless interactions.

## Features:

Interactive GUI: Engage with the chatbot through a clean and intuitive graphical interface.

Pattern Matching Responses: Responds to user inputs based on predefined patterns and responses.

Scrollable Chat Window: View the entire conversation history with ease using the scrollable text area.

Keyboard and Button Input: Send messages using the Enter key or the Send button.

Extensible Design: Easily add more patterns and responses to enhance chatbot capabilities.

## Technologies Used

1.Python 3.13: Core programming language used for development.

2.Tkinter: Standard Python library for creating GUI applications.

3.NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Used for natural language processing tasks like tokenization.

## Why GUI?

While command-line interfaces are functional, a graphical user interface (GUI) offers a more engaging and user-friendly experience. With GUI:

Enhanced User Experience: Users can interact with the chatbot in a more intuitive manner.

Visual Appeal: A well-designed GUI makes the application more appealing to users.

Ease of Use: Buttons and text fields simplify user interactions, especially for those less familiar with command-line operations.
